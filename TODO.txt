fix to not accidentally move when pressing arrow keys,
why
  FpsPlayer: TPlayer; // representation of FPS camera

  FpsPlayer := TPlayer.Create(SceneManager);
  SceneManager.Items.Add(FpsPlayer);
  SceneManager.Player := FpsPlayer;
  FpsPlayer.Blocked := true; // do not allow to move player in this game
or "NONE" does not work as it should?
